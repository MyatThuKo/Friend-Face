<h1> Challenge Day </h1> 
<h3> Day 60 of 100 Days of SwiftUI </h3> 

<p> The three challenges that I had to go in this project are 
<li> Fetch the data and parse it into User and Friend structs. </li> 
<li> Display a list of users with a little information about them. </li> 
<li> Create a detail view shown when a user is tapped, presenting more information about them </li> 
</p> 

<p> This is the JSON File for this project - https://www.hackingwithswift.com/samples/friendface.json </p>
